            <p>If you're using GitHub Pages, this particular form won't function as expected. GitHub Pages only allows static content, and it doesn't support forms that try to send data to external servers or use localhost. The form needs to be set up to send information to the same place it came from for it to work on GitHub Pages.

            <p>Looking at this form, it could function on GitHub Pages, but it depends on the security rules in effect. GitHub Pages typically permits forms with action attributes pointing to external servers. However, it's important to ensure that the server allows requests from different origins (cross-origin) and is reachable from GitHub Pages.</p>
