    <h1>Ways that .pngs are superior to .jpgs </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>PNG allows pictures to have see-through parts, making it useful for logos and graphics with transparent backgrounds.</p>
        </li>
       
        <li>
            <p>PNG is good for pictures that have clear edges, text, or drawings because it keeps the quality high and can make parts of the image see-through .</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>PNG supports a wide range of colours, able to support images that require different colours.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Ways that .pngs are inferior to .jpgs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>PNG files are not the best choice for storing photos on the internet because they are usually bigger in size compared to the same pictures saved in JPG format.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>With photos, it's better to use JPG because it can make the file size smaller without losing too much quality, thanks to its special compression technique.</p>
        </li>
    
    </ul>
